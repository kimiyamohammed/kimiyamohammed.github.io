Also add a line of code that will stop the clock after 10 ticks 
-- setTimeout(()=>clock.stop(),10000);
What is the inner function of the constructor function? 
-- render()
What is the local variable of the constructor function? 
-- timer
What is the clock “interface” returned by the constructor function? 
-- object of clock
What are the closures?
-- no closures
What are the private variables and functions? 
-- timer, render
What are the public methods? 
-- stop, start

How does this example illustrate that a JavaScript class is really a function and not an object? 
-- no relationship in this scenario.
